### Installation
```text
git clone git@github.com:SafouaneM/web-app-from-scratch-2223.git
```
And you should be good to go now, do not forget to implement your own api key in the api.js.
You can request an api key from this url, it'll take no longer then 1 minute to generate one
### !(Do note you need a riot games account to generate a key.)!
