## Control flow of the service worker
1. Set the value of CACHE_NAME constant to 'safouane.gg-cachingv2'.
2. Output hi to the console.
3. Add an event listener for the install event:
-  Output Service worker installing... to the console.
-  Open the cache specified by CACHE_NAME.
-  Add the files '/main.css', '/summoner', '/champions', and '/offline' to the cache.
4. Add an event listener for the activate event:
- Output Service worker activating... to the console.
5. Add an event listener for the fetch event:
- Output [Service Worker] Fetching... to the console.
-  Try to find a match for the requested resource in the cache.
-  If a match is found, return the cached response.
-  If a match is not found, fetch the resource from the network:
-  If the request method is not GET or the request URL does not start with http, return the response from the network.
-  Otherwise, put the response in the cache and return the response from the network.
-  If the fetch fails, return the cached /offline page.

And you should be good to go now, do not forget to implement your own api key in the api.js.
You can request an api key from this url, it'll take no longer then 1 minute to generate one
