### - Weblink 🔗 - If you feel the need to look what I've been doing,
#### - https://safouanem.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-2223/spa/public/final/webapp.html

- I tried to make an u.gg/op.gg clone for myself, and to my surprise I was able to finish more than I expected in the Wiki? I got a bit more in depth about the structure of the code etc.

### Installation
```text
git clone git@github.com:SafouaneM/web-app-from-scratch-2223.git
```
And you should be good to go now, do not forget to implement your own api key in the api.js.
You can request an api key from this url, it'll take no longer then 1 minute to generate one
### !(Do note you need a riot games account to generate a key.)!
